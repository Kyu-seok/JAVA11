# Object Oriented Programming

###### 4 principles of OOP
- [x] Encapsulation
- [x] Abstraction
- [x] Inheritence
- [x] Polymorphism

OOP is a programming model that organizes program with data and object instead of functions and logics. Object in OOP should be viewd as collection of methods and variables. By using OOP design, a single block of source code is devided with smaller parts of object which brings great advantage on productivity.

##### Pros of OOP

1. **Reusability.** By using inheritence, same code is reusable in different object by inheriting the parent.
2. **Productivity.** Programmers can construct new programs quicker through the use of multiple libraries and reusable code.
3. **Scalable.** Programmers can implement system functionalities independently.
4. **Security.** Using encapsulation and abstraction, complex code is hidden, software amintenance is easier and internet protocols are protected.
5. **Flexibility.** Polymorphism enables a single function to adapt to the class it is placed in. Different objects can also pass through the same interface.

##### Cons of OOP

1. **Inefficiency.** Depending on the size of the project, or subject of the project, using OOP might cause ineddiciency in developing state. When the project has few objects, but more on the functioalities which is not reused, the first time coding might be more extensive than other options.
2. **Complexity.** It is very complex to create programs based on the interaction of objects. Some of the key programming techniques, such as inheritance and polymorphism, can be a big challenging to comprehend initially.
